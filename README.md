Playing around with React.js, Babel, and Gulp
<br/><br/>
Attempting to learn React.js and peripherally Babel.js.
<br/><br/>
Also, as a matter necessity, learning to use Gulp with greater efficiency.

<strong>Note:</strong> An important observation about Babel and React with the newest versions<br/>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>available. Babel now requires a series of plugins to work effectively with<br/>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>React. There is a specific preset that Babel has established for jsx transformation.<br/>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>Though, there are other tools to accomplish the packaging of these tools, the<br/>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>following is done using Node's Package Manager, Webpack, and Gulp.
